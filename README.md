# TModUnpacker

TModUnpacker is a tool used to unpack data from Terraria mod (**.tmod**) file. It is possible to extract data such as images, sounds, description or even the source code if it is included in the build. It is compatible with old (<11) and new version.

## Usage

After running this command, a new directory is going to be created in your current working directory.
```sh
$ python unpack.py "path/to/file.tmod"
```
You can also just drag and drop the file on ***unpack.py***.

#### Please, keep in mind that the unpacked data may be copyrighted by their owners! Always check the mod license before unpacking a mod.
